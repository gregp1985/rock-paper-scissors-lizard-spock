# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock ... Further Testing

Below is dosumentation on further testing carried out on the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game Website

## Screens

I used my iPhone 15 to carry out tests on all pages as well as Google Inspect. Everything resized appropriately and looked good on all screen sizes. See below.

## Results

Using Continuous Play I played through every variation to confirm output results were correct across the board including all draws and that scores incremented correctly and did not increment on draws. Also the more I played the more the scores remained fairly level, indicating my random function to generate a choice by the computer was working as desired.
